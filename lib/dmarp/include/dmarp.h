/**
 * @file dmarp.h
 * @brief DMOD ARP Resolver - Public API
 *
 * dmarp resolves an IPv4 address to a MAC address on a directly-connected
 * link, using ARP (RFC 826) request/reply frames sent and received
 * through dmnetif_send()/dmnetif_receive() on a specific interface.
 * Successful resolutions are cached (keyed by interface + IP address) so
 * repeated lookups of the same destination don't send a fresh request
 * every time - see dmarp_resolve() and the cache functions below.
 *
 * IPv6 is out of scope: IPv6 neighbor discovery uses NDP (over ICMPv6),
 * not ARP, so every function here only ever deals with
 * dmip_family_v4 addresses.
 *
 * dmarp depends on dmnetif (to send/receive frames and read an
 * interface's own MAC/IP address) and dmip (for dmip_addr_t) - nothing
 * depends on dmarp, so this is a plain one-way dependency, not a DIF/MAL.
 * There is exactly one ARP cache per system - functions here are plain
 * Built-in API (dmod_dmarp_api).

/**
 * @brief How long a cache entry stays valid before dmarp_resolve() treats
 *        it as a miss and sends a fresh request
 *
 * Applies uniformly to every entry, however it got there (a real ARP
 * reply via dmarp_resolve(), or a manual dmarp_cache_insert()) - dmarp
 * has no separate "static/permanent" entry concept. 60 seconds is a
 * conservative default inspired by real ARP cache timeouts (which range
 * from tens of seconds to tens of minutes depending on the stack) - short
 * enough that a NIC swap or DHCP re-lease on the far end doesn't stay
 * hidden for long.

 * (an ARP-opcode-reply frame whose sender protocol address equals `ip`)
 * until either a reply arrives or `timeout_ms` elapses. A successful
